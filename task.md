# Canvas MCP Project Status

## Current Status and Progress

We've made significant progress on implementing the Canvas MCP project:

### Test Status:

1. **Database Initialization Tests (test_init_db.py)**:
   - All tests PASSING (4/4)
   - Successfully validates table creation, schema, and views

2. **Canvas API Client Tests (test_canvas_client.py)**:
   - All tests PASSING (6/6)
   - Fixed issues with:
     - SQL syntax (replaced ON CONFLICT clauses with SELECT + INSERT/UPDATE)
     - MagicMock object handling in tests
     - Proper type conversion for SQLite

3. **MCP Server Tests (test_server.py)**:
   - All tests PASSING (9/9)
   - Fixed issues with:
     - Date filtering in upcoming deadlines function
     - Search functionality to find multiple matches

### Integration Testing:

1. **Direct Canvas API Access**:
   - Successfully authenticated with Canvas API
   - Can get user information and list courses
   - Found 44 courses available to the user

2. **Issues with Canvas Client Implementation**:
   - Course syncing fails with unauthorized error when using get_user() method
   - Direct course access via current_user.get_courses() works fine
   - Need to modify sync_courses() to use the working method

3. **Next Steps for Integration**:
   - Implement term filter to only get current semester courses
   - Fix sync_courses() method to use the working API access pattern
   - Complete testing of assignments, modules, and announcements sync

### Key Components Implemented:

1. **Database Schema (db_schema.md)**:
   - Comprehensive schema with 12 tables covering all Canvas data
   - Well-defined relationships and proper indexes
   - Includes views for common queries

2. **Database Initialization (init_db.py)**:
   - Creates all tables and views
   - Sets up proper constraints
   - Working correctly (all tests passing)

3. **Canvas API Client (canvas_client.py)**:
   - Handles synchronization between Canvas API and SQLite database
   - Includes methods for courses, assignments, modules, announcements
   - Fixed SQL syntax issues, now all unit tests are passing
   - Need to update for real-world API usage based on integration testing

4. **MCP Server (server.py)**:
   - Provides tools and resources for Claude integration
   - All query functionality working correctly (all tests passing)

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Term Filter for Courses**:
   - Modify sync_courses to only retrieve current/recent term courses
   - Look at reference code in /Users/darin/projects/canvas_grab for inspiration
   - Update integration test with term filtering

2. **Fix Canvas Client Authentication**:
   - Update sync_courses method to use the working API access pattern
   - Ensure proper error handling for API requests
   - Add retries and rate limiting

3. **Complete Integration Testing**:
   - Test with real Canvas API credentials
   - Verify full workflow from API to database to MCP server
   - Document any additional issues found

4. **Implement Syllabus Parsing**:
   - Add functionality to extract dates and assignments from syllabus HTML
   - Update database to store parsed information

5. **Enhance MCP Tools and Resources**:
   - Add more specialized queries for student needs
   - Implement subscription for content updates
   - Improve formatting of resource content

## Technical Debt Items

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Improve exception handling in Canvas API client
   - Add more detailed error messages
   - Implement logging

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Add more edge case tests
   - Add integration tests for full workflow
   - Mock external dependencies more thoroughly

3. **Documentation**:
   - Add more detailed API documentation
   - Document database schema relationships
   - Add examples for common queries

## GitHub Issues Addressed

This implementation addresses:
- #13 (DBSchema): Complete schema design with 12 tables implemented
- #4 (Parse Course Syllabi & Calendar Integration): Framework for syllabus storage and calendar events
- #11 (Integrate Assignment & Module Info from Canvas): API client for Canvas data synchronization
- #10 (Allow opt-out): User_Courses table with opt-out functionality
