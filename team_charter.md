## Team Charter

(We will copy this info into our README for clarity, though the assignment says it may just be appended.)

### Communication Norms
1. **Team Meetings**: We plan to meet **twice a week** via Zoom/Google Meet (e.g., Mondays and Thursdays at 6 PM).
2. **Communication**: We use a **Discord Server** for day-to-day updates.  
3. **Response Time**: Team members strive to respond to Discord messages within **24 hours**.

### Operating Guidelines
1. **Decision-Making**: We decide by **majority vote** if consensus can’t be reached.  
2. **Performance Expectations**: Everyone should complete tasks on time and with acceptable quality.  
3. **Cooperation/Attitudes**: We maintain a positive environment, help each other with blocking issues.  
4. **Meeting Attendance**: Everyone attends or notifies the team if they must miss. Punctuality is expected.  
5. **Workload Distribution**: We will monitor tasks on our Kanban board to avoid one or two people doing the majority.  
6. **Procrastination Handling**: We’ll set internal deadlines 1–2 days before the actual due date to buffer.  

### Conflict Management
1. **Resolving Differences**: We discuss openly in Discord or in a meeting. If unresolved, we escalate to the instructor.  
2. **Non-Responsive Members**: We attempt direct contact. If still unresponsive, we reassign tasks and inform the instructor.  
3. **Unexpected Issues**: If someone faces an emergency, the rest of the team divides their tasks.  

### Outside Commitments
- We have typical student commitments, but no known major conflicts. If they arise, we’ll let the team know ASAP.

**Team Agreement**:  
All team members have read and agree to these norms.
