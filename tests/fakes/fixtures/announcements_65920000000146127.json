Hope everyone is staying dry this stormy Sunday. Two quick updates as we head into our last few weeks.</p>\n<p>1) Class will be in-person on Monday (tomorrow). In Sprint 4, you will be swapping projects with another group, and I think the handoff will be smoother if people can talk to each other (similar to project groups meeting for the first time). This will be our last in-person meeting until the final day, April 23!</p>\n<p>2) I'm canceling class on Wednesday so you have more time to work on Sprint 4 (and, truthfully, because I've been having trouble lining up guest speakers).</p>\n<p>By the way, belated reminder that Sprint 3's due date was not on Friday - it's due tomorrow when class starts (Canvas says tonight, but do what you've got to do to be able to hand off work tomorrow). See you all tomorrow!</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_65920000000000001/attachments/11112436/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>",

Couple things as we go into the last week before spring break:</p>\n<p>1) <strong>Online class tomorrow, again: </strong>I had the flu this last week and I think I'm right on the tail end of the contagious period. To be extra cautious about not infecting anyone (0/10 would not recommend), I'm moving Monday's lecture online as well. I'm expecting to be back IRL on Wednesday, but if I still have any symptoms tomorrow I'll probably revisit that. I'll post the link in Discord and here just before lecture starts.</p>\n<p>2) <strong>Project setup deadline extended to Friday evening:</strong> my goal is for no one to do any work over Spring Break, but with most people taking their late days on Milestone 3, I think the project deliverables for next week are likely to get crammed into just a couple days if I keep the Wednesday deadline. I'm pushing it back to Friday so people can really feel like their groups are aligned on what they want to build and can put some careful thought into their project plans.</p>\n<p>Lastly, sorry I'm moving so slowly on grading! I wanted to get Milestone 2 grades up this weekend but was still recovering. I will make sure that coming out of Spring Break, everything so far has been graded, and I'll prioritize giving prompt feedback on project plans in case any groups might want to pivot.</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_65920000000000001/attachments/11112436/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>",

Couple things I wanted to highlight going into this next week:</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Project Milestone</strong> <strong>3</strong>: it's still due Wednesday night, but I'm canceling the deployment requirement, so you just have to get it to run locally. This will hopefully let you all focus on JS/React and conserve Google Cloud credits for the late stages of the group project.</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Group Project</strong>: I'll be announcing this in class tomorrow, but I'm assigning groups this week and assigning a first deliverable (project proposal + team charter) due before Spring Break. I'm thinking we'll work in groups of five, and you're welcome to choose a group yourself if you have classmates with similar project interests (no restrictions on tech stack for the group project btw). I'll assign groups on Wednesday, but anyone who comes to me with a group formed before then can stick with the group they've chosen.</p>\n<p>Have a good Sunday!</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_65920000000000001/attachments/11112436/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>",

A few announcements as we're finishing up Milestone 1:</p>\n<p>1) Milestone 2 will be posted later tonight! It's going to involve adding some database-backed functionality to your Milestone 1 app. We'll cover how to provision a Google Cloud database and connect our apps to it on Monday. I recommend starting on the milestone and developing locally in the meantime!</p>\n<p>2) I left today's demo unfinished, but in the interest of time I've decided to go ahead and post a finished version to the class org: <a href=\"https://github.com/cs540-s25/setup-and-demos/tree/master/lect6-demo\">https://github.com/cs540-s25/setup-and-demos/tree/master/lect6-demo </a></p>\n<p>On Monday we'll discuss how to improve this app, and then deploy it (including cloud database setup). I recommend reading through the code so you get to see SQLAlchemy queries and writes in action. Also, can you spot all the security problems?</p>\n<p>Btw, if you want to run this app (or develop locally using Postgres), you'll need to do some installation, which I didn't cover in class. I've started a running doc of all installation instructions for this class, and added Postgres: <a href=\"https://github.com/cs540-s25/setup-and-demos/blob/master/cs540-setup.md\">https://github.com/cs540-s25/setup-and-demos/blob/master/cs540-setup.md</a></p>\n<p>You will have to do this installation to be able to make progress on the second project milestone!</p>\n<p>3) New Discord invite if anyone needs it: https://discord.gg/W6vwDkGh</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_65920000000000001/attachments/11112436/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>",

A few announcements:</p>\n<p>1) Emory is keeping things remote tomorrow, so I'm moving class to Zoom. We'll be covering Git, a topic which many of you indicated you have significant familiarity with -- if that's you (read: if you know branching like the back of your hand), you can decide whether you want a refresher or some extra sleep. Zoom details:<br><br><span><a href=\"https://us06web.zoom.us/j/84426858706?pwd=5G6j5eZ63Lloe9D5UwtxpjOdTn37aw.1\">https://us06web.zoom.us/j/84426858706?pwd=5G6j5eZ63Lloe9D5UwtxpjOdTn37aw.1</a><br><br>Meeting ID: 844 2685 8706<br>Passcode: 733355</span></p>\n<p>2) The class Discord server is live: <span><a href=\"https://discord.gg/QADXBQE6\">https://discord.gg/QADXBQE6. As a reminder, this is where I'll hold remote office hours, and generally answer questions (feel free to ask and answer each other's questions too). Please join!</a></span></p>\n<p><span>3) You all should have received invites to a GitHub organization called cs540-s25. If you filled out the first survey (Homework 1) before today and *haven't* received an invite, please reach out to me so we can debug. This is where you'll be submitting code assignments, and where I'll be posting demo code and other technical guides.</span></p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_65920000000000001/attachments/11112436/canvas_global_app.js\"></script>",
